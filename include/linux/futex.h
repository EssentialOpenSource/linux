 *  01 : Shared futex (PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED)

 *  10 : Shared futex (PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED)
 *       (but private mapping on an mm, and reference taken on it)

 * futex_exit_done - Sets the tasks futex state to FUTEX_STATE_DEAD
 * @tsk:	task to set the state on
 *
 * Set the futex exit state of the task lockless. The futex waiter code
 * observes that state when a task is exiting and loops until the task has
 * actually finished the futex cleanup. The worst case for this is that the
 * waiter runs through the wait loop until the state becomes visible.
 *
 * This has two callers:
 *
 * - futex_mm_release() after the futex exit cleanup has been done
 *
 * - do_exit() from the recursive fault handling path.
 *
 * In case of a recursive fault this is best effort. Either the futex exit
 * code has run already or not. If the OWNER_DIED bit has been set on the
 * futex then the waiter can take it over. If not, the problem is pushed
 * back to user space. If the futex exit code did not run yet, then an
 * already queued waiter might block forever, but there is nothing which
 * can be done about that.
